### Challenge description

### What is the goal?
The goal in the project is to improve my programming logic skills with javascript, learn more about css and the structure of html.

### How needs to work?
The user need to give the system a word or phrase to encrypt in a text square, another text square gonna give the encrypt text or deciphered text. 
Then the "hello" in the fist square becomes a "henterllober" and vice versa. 
To encrypt the text  follow the next rules:
```
The letter 'e' is converted to 'enter'.
The letter 'i' is converted to 'imes'.
The letter 'a' is converted to 'ai'.
The letter 'o' is converted to 'ober'.
The letter 'u' is converted to 'ufat'.
And vice versa.

It should work only with lowercase letters.
Letters with accents or special characters should not be used.
    Dev note: How my first lenguage is spanish "Ã±" is a exception.
